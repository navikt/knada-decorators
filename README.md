NAISFlow Decorators
===================

> DecoratorController is an API provided by Metacontroller, designed to facilitate adding new behavior to existing
> resources. You can define rules for which resources to watch, as well as filters on labels and annotations.

Learn more over at [metacontroller.app](https://metacontroller.app/api/decoratorcontroller/). This is hopefully going to
be a collection of decorators that will aid our work with Kubeflow.

## Metacontroller

The Metacontroller is installed via [kubeflow-yaml](https://github.com/navikt/kubeflow-yaml/).
